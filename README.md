# Bit by Bit Demo Sites 

These are some demonstration websites meant to introduce certain HTML and CSS concepts. Many of them may be intentionally flawed or broken to demonstrate a point.


## Organization

Any standalone websites that dont require external files (such as JS or CSS) live in the main repository folder. Anything that needs multiple files gets its own folder.


## The Sites

|    Site Name   |    Purpose      |
|--------|----------|
|   forgot-to-close-tags    |    demonstrate what can happen if you forget to close an HTML tag      |
|    Boxes   |    This site is meant to demonstrate that you can think of any element of HTML as a box. It demonstrates many different kinds of elements like inline ancd block elements and has some CSS to exaggerate and add color to emphasize the presence of the box model. Just remove the CSS to see the "normal" version.     |
|    backgrounds/full   |    This site is meant to demonstrate how to do whole-site backgrounds including solid colors and images, as well as how to customize those backgrounds    |
|    backgrounds/ackground-image ideas   |    This site is meant to provide some ideas for interesting and different ways you can use background-image in your site   |
